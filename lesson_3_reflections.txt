1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
   When collaboration/review is required and the work needs to be accessible on a non-local repo. 

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?
   Mainly so you can control when to sync the file at correct times to reflect the changes you want. 
You don't want to be working on a file that may be pulled in before changes have been committed.
